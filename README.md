# Labcoat

Labcoat is an HTML5 development environment for Quirrel, a analytical query language for JSON data.

You can write Quirrel scripts, execute them, and visualize the results, in a visual, self-contained environment.

This is the next-generation of Labcoat (formerly known as Labcoat 2), which does not yet work.

For a working version of Labcoat, see [Labcoat Legacy](http://github.com/precog/labcoat-legacy).
